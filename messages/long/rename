Update the title (human-readable name) of a bundle.

The title is stored in .bundle/META.json and is used for display
and identification purposes. The bundle checksum and other metadata
remain unchanged.

Examples:
  # Update bundle title
  bundle rename /path/to/bundle "New Title"

  # Update with JSON output
  bundle rename /path/to/bundle "New Title" --json

Output:
  The command confirms the new title and displays the bundle path.
  Use --json flag for machine-readable output.

Note:
  Only the title field is modified. All other metadata (checksum,
  author, creation date) remains unchanged.
