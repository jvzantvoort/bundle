Show detailed information about a bundle.

Displays a human-readable summary of the bundle metadata, files and current
state. Use this command to inspect the title, author, checksum, created
timestamp, number of files and total size.

Examples:

	bundle info /path/to/bundle
	bundle info /path/to/bundle -j    # print machine-readable JSON

JSON output fields (when using `--json`):

- `path` - absolute bundle path
- `title` - bundle title (string)
- `checksum` - SHA256 checksum of the bundle metadata
- `files` - number of files recorded in the bundle
- `size_bytes` - total size in bytes
- `created_at` - RFC3339 timestamp when the bundle was created
- `author` - author string from metadata
- `verified` - boolean indicating last-known verification status
- `tags` - array of normalized tags attached to the bundle
- `replicas` - array of replica locations (if any)

Notes:

If the target path is not a bundle the command will return an error. Use
`bundle create` to initialize a new bundle, and `bundle verify` to re-check
the integrity of the bundle contents.
