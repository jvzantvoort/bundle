# Tasks: Bundle Library Core Implementation

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-bundle-core/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ‚úÖ, spec.md ‚úÖ, research.md ‚úÖ, data-model.md ‚úÖ, contracts/ ‚úÖ, quickstart.md ‚úÖ

**Tests**: Test tasks included per constitution requirement (Development Workflow section mandates unit, integration, and contract tests)

**Organization**: Tasks grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Project uses single-project Go structure following user preferences:
- Library components: `checksum/`, `metadata/`, `state/`, `tag/`, `scanner/`, `lock/`, `bundle/`
- CLI commands: `cmd/bundle/`, `cmd/create/`, `cmd/verify/`, etc.
- Tests: `tests/integration/`, `tests/contract/`
- Help messages: `messages/long/`, `messages/usage/`, `messages/short/`
- Utilities: `utils/`, `config/`

- [X] T003 [P] Create project directory structure (cmd/, config/, utils/, messages/, tests/)
- [X] T004 [P] Create README.md with project overview and build instructions
- [X] T005 [P] Create .gitignore for Go projects (ignore binaries, test artifacts)

---

- [ ] T008 [P] Implement filepath utilities in utils/filepath.go (path normalization, .bundle/ exclusion)
- [ ] T009 [P] Implement output helpers in utils/output.go (stdout/stderr, JSON vs table formatting)
- [ ] T010 Setup logrus configuration in config/main.go (log levels, structured fields)
- [ ] T011 [P] Create help message directory structure (messages/long/, messages/usage/, messages/short/)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - **BLOCKS all user stories**
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) - **MVP CRITICAL**
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) - Can run parallel to US1 if staffed
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) - Can run parallel to US1/US2 if staffed
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: No dependencies on other stories - foundational functionality
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: No dependencies on US1 - can start after Foundational phase
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: No dependencies on US1/US2 - can start after Foundational phase

### Within Each User Story

- Library components before CLI commands (library-first architecture)
- Tests can be written in parallel with implementation (TDD encouraged)
- Core functionality before extended features
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

**Setup Phase**:
- T003, T004, T005 can run in parallel

**Foundational Phase**:
- T008, T009, T011 can run in parallel (different files)
- T012-T015 tests can run in parallel

**User Story 1**:
- T016-T019 checksum library tasks can run in parallel
- T022-T024 checksum tests can run in parallel
- T025, T028, T032, T036 (different library components) can run in parallel
- T044, T045 integration tests can run in parallel
- T047, T048, T053, T058 help messages can run in parallel
- T059-T061 contract tests can run in parallel

**User Story 2**:
- T062-T066 tag library tasks can run in parallel
- T071-T074 info command can run in parallel with T075-T080 tag command
- T081-T083 contract tests can run in parallel

**User Story 3**:
- T091-T092 contract tests can run in parallel

**Polish Phase**:
- T093-T095, T096-T097, T099-T100, T104 can run in parallel

Task T028: Define Metadata struct in metadata/types.go
Task T032: Define State struct in state/main.go
Task T036: Implement lock acquisition in lock/main.go

# After core libraries, launch tests in parallel:
Task T022: Test streaming checksum
Task T027: Test scanner
Task T031: Test metadata
Task T035: Test state
Task T039: Test lock
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T005)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T006-T015) - **CRITICAL BLOCKING PHASE**
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T016-T061)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test `bundle create` and `bundle verify` end-to-end
5. Run integration and contract tests
6. Build binary and validate with quickstart examples
7. Deploy/demo MVP if ready

**Estimated Tasks for MVP**: 61 tasks (T001-T061)

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Foundation** (T001-T015) ‚Üí Project structure ready
2. **MVP Release** (+ T016-T061) ‚Üí Core bundle creation and verification working
3. **Metadata Release** (+ T062-T083) ‚Üí Tagging and info commands added
4. **Full Release** (+ T084-T107) ‚Üí Complete feature set with polish

Each increment adds value without breaking previous functionality.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers after Foundational phase completes:

1. **Team completes Setup + Foundational together** (T001-T015)
2. **Once T015 done, split work**:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 1 library components (T016-T043)
   - **Developer B**: User Story 1 CLI commands (T046-T058)
   - **Developer C**: User Story 1 tests (T022-T024, T027, T031, T035, T039, T044-T045, T059-T061)
3. **After US1 complete**:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 2 (T062-T083)
   - **Developer B**: User Story 3 (T084-T092)
   - **Developer C**: Polish & validation (T093-T107)

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no shared dependencies, safe to parallelize
- [Story] label enables tracking which user story each task serves
- Each user story is independently completable and testable
- Constitution requires tests (Development Workflow section), so test tasks included
- Go doc comments required for all exported functions (Principle II)
- Exit codes must be 0/1/2 per constitution (Principle III)
- Logrus structured logging required (Principle V)
- Commit after each logical group of related tasks
- Run `go test ./...` frequently to catch issues early
- Avoid: vague tasks, concurrent edits to same file, cross-story dependencies
