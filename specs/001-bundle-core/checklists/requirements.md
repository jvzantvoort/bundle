# Specification Quality Checklist: Bundle Library Core Implementation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-30  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

âœ… **ALL CHECKS PASSED**

### Content Quality Assessment
- Specification is written in user-centric language focusing on DAM use cases
- No technology-specific details in requirements or success criteria
- Business value clearly articulated (content integrity, asset organization, audit capability)

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
- All 15 functional requirements are testable with clear verification methods
- Success criteria use measurable metrics (time, accuracy percentages, file counts)
- Edge cases comprehensively cover error scenarios and boundary conditions
- Assumptions clearly document environmental prerequisites
- Out of scope explicitly defined to prevent scope creep

### Feature Readiness Assessment
- Three prioritized user stories (P1-P3) provide independent, testable slices
- Each user story includes acceptance scenarios in Given/When/Then format
- Success criteria align with user stories and provide clear definition of done
- Specification ready for planning phase

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan` command
- No clarifications needed - all requirements are unambiguous
- Feature scope is well-bounded with clear exclusions
- Constitutional compliance: Follows Library-First + CLI-First principles (Principles II & III)
